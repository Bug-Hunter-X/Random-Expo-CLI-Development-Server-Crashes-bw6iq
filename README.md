# Random Expo CLI Development Server Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server crashes randomly without providing any error messages in the console. This issue significantly hampers the development process due to its unpredictable nature and lack of debugging information.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the development server for random crashes.  The crashes are intermittent and might not occur immediately.

## Potential Causes (Speculation)

- Memory leaks within Expo or a dependency.
- Resource exhaustion on the development machine.
- Asynchronous operations causing race conditions.
- Issues within the project codebase, although no specific code patterns are currently identified.

## Workaround

The proposed solution is to add more robust error handling and logging to the project and expo's configuration. This will help to identify the exact issues that cause the crash. It also involve monitoring the system resources to prevent resource exhaustion and potential memory leaks, and also using a more recent expo version.
