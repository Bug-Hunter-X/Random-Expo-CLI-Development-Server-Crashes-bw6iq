To mitigate this issue, we can implement comprehensive logging to capture potential error information, even when the server crashes unexpectedly.  This solution focuses on better logging and adding more error handling.  For example, a global error handler can catch and log any unhandled exceptions.  Note, this does not directly fix the root cause of the crashes (which may be a bug in Expo itself, or within a specific project dependency), but it helps in identifying those causes.

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js

// Global error handler
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
  console.error('Uncaught exception:', err);
  // Optionally, log to a file or external service
});

process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
  console.error('Unhandled Rejection at:', promise, 'reason:', reason);
  // Optionally, log to a file or external service
});

// Add more logging throughout the application to trace execution flow and identify potential issues
```

Additional steps might involve monitoring system resources (CPU, memory) while the Expo server is running to check for resource exhaustion.
